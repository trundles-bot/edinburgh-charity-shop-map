# Edinburgh Charity Shop Map
A London-tube style map shoping Edinburgh charity shop locations. Not intented to be definative!

Note: this map is based on the grid, so remember to turn it on, using `View` > `Page Grid`. Each line is a simple stroke, but is rounded (when I remember) using `Path` > `Path Effects` > (select line) > (plus sign at the bottom of the Path Effects pane) > `Corners (Fillet/Chamfer)` > Radius (field) > `15` (I've used `20` in the past, but this doesn't match the curve of the Princes Street - Queen Street block). I tend to redraw the lines, if I need to change them.

This is an [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) file. It's not optimised for web use. A quick way to optimise it for online use would be to use [SVG OMG](https://jakearchibald.github.io/svgomg/) or [Nano](https://vecta.io/nano).

This file uses [Trebuchet MS](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/font-list/trebuchet-ms), which is not a free typeface, but which comes bundles with many different versions of Microsoft Windows. This typeface was selected due to its similarity to [Johnston](https://tfl.gov.uk/info-for/suppliers-and-contractors/font-requests), the typeface used on the current London Tube map. There are other free typefaces which could be substituted, for example [Lato](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato).
