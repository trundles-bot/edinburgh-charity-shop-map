# Edinburgh Charity Shop Map
A London-tube style map shoping Edinburgh charity shop locations. Not intented to be definative!

This is an [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) file. It's not optimised for web use. A quick way to optimise it for online use would be to use [SVG OMG](https://jakearchibald.github.io/svgomg/) or [Nano](https://vecta.io/nano).

This file uses [Trebuchet MS](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/font-list/trebuchet-ms), which is not a free typeface, but which comes bundles with many different versions of Windows. This typeface was selected due to its similarity to [Johnston](https://tfl.gov.uk/info-for/suppliers-and-contractors/font-requests), the typeface used on the current London Tube map. There are other free typefaces which could be substituted, for example [Lato](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato).
